            <p>
                I was challenged to create a certain environment in Amazon Web Service (AWS):
            </p>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Create two Virtual Machines (VMs, or Instances as they are called in AWS).</li>
                    <li>Add a secrets manager (Key Management Server - KMS) and storage (S3).</li>
                    <li>Make one instance accessible through the internet and the second inaccessible.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                The idea of the challenge was to get myself familiar with AWS, after getting some courses and experience with Azure.<br>
                The challenge itself seemed simple enough, but it felt a little bit "empty" just provisioning the environment, so I decided to give it some life with this simple application. <br>
                <b>However</b>, it should be noted that the main goal of this little project is the environment and learning how to work with AWS, the application was a secondary goal, which is why this website or the code running it might seem a little bit sloppy.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <div>
                <h2>How Does This Work</h2>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>Overview</h3>
            </div>
            <div id="Overview">
                <p>
                    I realized the environment can work as an application with a Front-End Server (the VM accessible from the internet) and a Back-End Server (the VM inaccessible from the internet).<br>
                    Only the Back-End server will be able to access the application's resources (the KMS and S3 bucket). <br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    The general idea of the solution works as such:
                </p>
                <p>
                    <img src="{{ solution_image }}">
                </p>
                <p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>User reaches the Front-End server from the internet.</li>
                        <li>The Front-End server sends the user this web page.</li>
                        <li>When the user clicks the "Generate Cat" button, the Front-End server opens a socket to the Back-End server.</li>
                        <li>The Back-End server accepts the Front-End's connection, asks the S3 Cats Bucket (or Buck-Cat, if you will) for a temporary signed URL, and sends it back to the Front-End through the socket session.</li>
                        <li>The Front-End server presents the image to the user by using the temporary URL.</li>
                        <li>The images in the Buck-Cat are encrypted with a KMS Key which is held in KMS</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
            </div>
            <div>

                    Now it's possible to look into each component indvidually, let's use this table:

                        During deployment, as the app was moved from the local development environment (a local Ubuntu VM) into a container in the respective EC2 Instance,
                        there was a series of interesting bugs that had to be taken care of due to the change:

                                    The development environment used a programmatic IAM user in order to get to the Buck-Cat and KMS Key,
                                    the credentials are held within the AWS SDK config file (so they won't be kept in the code).<br>
                                    When the program was moved into a container, it got the credentials through the IAM Role, which was applied on the EC2 instance in which it resides,
                                    however, it seems that there's some kind of difference in the way the SDK reaches the credentials in this case.
